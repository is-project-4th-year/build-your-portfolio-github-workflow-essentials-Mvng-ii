## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### **🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation 👀`: I assumed branching was mostly for large team projects.

`Reality 😅`: Even solo developers benefit a lot! It helped me safely experiment with sections like About Me without damaging the main code.

`Impact 💡`: I created separate branches for each milestone, tested safely, and merged confidently via pull requests.

---

**2. Concept: Pull Requests**

`Expectation 👀`: I thought pull requests were just for team code reviews.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out, they’re also great for personal accountability and clear documentation of changes.

`Impact 💡`: I used pull requests for each milestone. It made the review and merging process clean and traceable.

---

**3. Concept: Project Boards**

`Expectation 👀`: I didn’t think I’d need a board for a small project.

`Reality 😅`: Project boards helped me visually track progress and prioritize my work better.

`Impact 💡`: I used “To Do”, “In Progress”, and “Done” columns and moved issues across them as I completed each feature.

---

**4. Concept: Merge Conflicts**

`Expectation 👀`: I thought Git magically handled all code merges.

`Reality 😅`: I encountered a merge conflict and had to resolve it manually by choosing what code to keep.

`Impact 💡`: I simulated and resolved a merge conflict between the “projects” and “about” section branches—learned a lot!
